## Overview 

RentMatch was created as an entry by a team of myself and three other students for the 2021 Meteor Impact Hackaton. The concept was an app to streamline the process of finding a place to live. Our main requirements were that it should:

1. Make discovering rentals fast and easy
2. Make keeping track of applications fast and easy 
3. Reduce the number of rental scams

This concept was born from my own frustration in finding a place to live in the SF Bay Area on Craigslist. While Craigslist does feature the greatest number of available rentals in one place, it also has a confusing interface and requires the user to email a potential landlord in a standard email client. After emailing several landlords, it becomes very easy to lose track on which ones you've already tried to contact. And of the landlords who do reply (most of them don't), several of them are obvious scams.

## Implementation 

Our solution to make browsing easier was to adopt a card-swiping interface that's commonly found on dating apps such as Tinder or Hinge. Selecting the heart icon automatically alerts the landlord, while selecting the reject icon removes the card from the stack. 

The landlord can see a list of their rentals and a list of anyone who's applied. They can quickly view important stats about the applicant, such as the number of tenants and number of pets. They can also click on the applicant's card to view a biography saved to the user's profile. 

## Personal contribution

The project was my idea and design, and primarily my implementation as well, with around 96% of all commits to the main branch.
